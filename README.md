Preamble:
This is a repo setup to explore Netbeans and Github. It's primary directive is to serve a dual purpose of exploring git based source control (including various facts of version control branching, merging etc) and also a a collaborative forum with members of the object oriented programming class i'm part of.

As with all endeavours at this point, this will be a iterative by-the-seat-of-my pants effort to learn the ropes in an effort to create a system whereby all my future projects will follow.

Nature of the Application:
Develop an application that allows the user to play a Hangman game.  The game should store a secret word (which you can choose and hard code in to a variable) and allow the user to guess the word one letter at a time.  The game should begin by printing a * for every letter in the word. When the user guesses a letter correctly, that letter should replace the appropriate * and the updated string should be printed to the user.  

For example, if the secret word is house, the application first prints ***** 
and when the user guesses the letter o the output should be *o***.
