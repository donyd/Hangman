Preamble:
This is a repo setup to explore Netbeans and Github. It's primary directive is to serve a dual purpose of exploring git based source control (including various facts of version control branching, merging etc) and also a a collaborative forum with members of the object oriented programming class i'm part of.

As with all endeavours at this point, this will be a iterative by-the-seat-of-my pants effort to learn the ropes in an effort to create a system whereby all my future projects will follow.

Nature of the Application:
Awaiting info
